# Open-Source-Data-Visualization
Open Source Data Visualization Music

## Description
My project is about the data visualization of open source music. I used three categories for the data visualization: MusicInterests, MusicListens and MusicDownloads. I have made a chart of these values of the songs. So for every category there is one graphic, based on values of different songs. The graphs look like a music wave. These data is from [FreeMusicArchive](http://freemusicarchive.org). I also made a combination of the three graphs in an animation. Here the values change between the three categories. The sound wave changes in shape as a result of the data.
